  <p> This line chart shows the top 5 countries that contributes to Taiwan's tourism numbers. As we can see, Taiwan attracts over 10 million tourists from 2015 to 2019 and the numbers are steadily increasing. With China being the number one contributor, contributing almosts 50% of the tourists numbers in Taiwan. Followed by Japan and South Korea, this could be due their geographical location being near Taiwan making it a cheap destination to visit as well. </p>

      <p> This last visualisation shows the purpose of tourists visiting Taiwan in 2019. Leisure is definitely one of the main reasons people visit Taiwan, followed by 'Others' as quite a majority did not state their purpose and for business and visiting their relatives. We can select each specific purpose of visit and get the actual value. </p>
